🎉 UPDATE v3.3.8 - Bug fixes, stability improvements, and new features

✨ WHAT IT DOES

📌 Pin & Organize Your Important Chats
Open any chat and hover over the avatar in the chat header to see the pin icon. Click it to save the chat as a favorite. Your pinned chats appear at the top of your sidebar for instant access.
Choose between carousel, 3-column grid, or 4-column grid layouts! Drag and drop avatars to reorder your pinned chats exactly how you want them. Pinned chats show a green pin badge to indicate they're favorited. Enable auto-collapse to automatically hide the pinned section when empty.

💬 Custom Status Updates (NEW v3.2)
Let your colleagues know what you're up to! Set your custom status with any emoji and text message. Your status appears next to your avatar in the sidebar and in chat headers when others message you. Set optional expiry times (30m, 1h, 4h, today, this week, or never) for automatic status clearing. Perfect for letting people know you're in meetings, on break, working focused, or on vacation. Update your status anytime by clicking your avatar in the sidebar.

@ Mentions Panel
Never miss when someone mentions you! The Mentions Panel shows all messages that mention you across all chats in one convenient sidebar. See unread mentions with badges, click any mention to jump directly to the message. Perfect for staying on top of conversations where you're specifically called out.

✍️ Draft Messages with ADAS (Accidental Deletion Assistance)
Never lose your thoughts! The extension automatically saves draft messages as you type. Switch between chats without losing your unfinished messages. Access all your drafts from the Drafts Panel in the sidebar.
NEW: ADAS (Accidental Deletion Assistance) provides a 60-second countdown when you delete a draft, giving you time to recover it if deleted by accident. No more losing important messages due to accidental clicks!

💬 Thread Panel
View all threads for any chat in a convenient side panel. The Thread Panel shows all threaded conversations with unread badges, making it easy to track replies and never miss important updates. Click any thread to jump directly to it in the conversation. The panel updates automatically in real-time as new threads arrive or replies are posted.

🔎 Channel Message Search Panel
Search messages within specific channels using the dedicated search panel. Click the search icon in any chat header to open the panel. Use advanced query syntax: comma (,) for AND operators and pipe (|) for OR operators. For example, "meeting,notes" finds messages with both words, while "urgent|asap" finds messages with either word. Perfect for finding important information in long conversations. Toggle the search button override in settings to open the search panel directly from the sidebar button.

📹 Google Meet Integration
Create instant Google Meet links directly from any chat! Connect your Google account once, then click the Meet button in any chat header to generate a meeting link. Customize the meeting invite text, set default duration (15-60 minutes), and optionally review meeting details before creating. The extension only accesses your calendar to create meeting events - no other data is accessed or stored.

🔄 Recent Chat Switcher
The extension remembers your last 5 conversations, making it easy to switch between active chats. Quick toggle: tap Cmd/Ctrl + \\ to instantly jump to your last conversation. Hold the modifier key and press \\ repeatedly to cycle through all recent chats. Perfect for multitasking across multiple ongoing discussions.

🔍 Lightning-Fast Smart Search

The search shows your pinned chats first, then your 5 most recent conversations, and all organization members. Click on a result to open an existing chat or create a new direct conversation. You can also view profiles or copy email addresses directly from search results. The Smart Database achieves 95%+ local search success with zero API calls.

⌨️ Navigate with Keyboard Shortcuts
Use keyboard shortcuts to quickly search and switch between conversations (Cmd/Ctrl + / for search, Cmd/Ctrl + \\ to toggle recent chats). Find what you need without reaching for your mouse. Windows users can customize their modifier key (Ctrl, Alt, or both) in settings.

🔘 Customizable Floating Button
A beautiful floating button provides quick access to search and recent chats. Personalize the button color with any color you like! The icon color automatically adjusts for perfect contrast (WCAG compliant). Choose between single-click for recent chats or double-click for search. Drag the button anywhere on your screen for optimal placement.

⚙️ Flexible Feature Toggles
